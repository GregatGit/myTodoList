# myTodoList
This is a todo list written entirely in vanilla.js to strengthen core js skills.
I choose to do this on Git use git's version control.
The project can be viewed on https://gregatgit.github.io/myTodoList/
While the it is very simple it uses a lot of js that is often skipped.

You can do the project for free at https://watchandcode.com .
